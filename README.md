<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Skystead Christmas is a festive-themed hidden object game where every click costs a snowball, and every snowball requires some snow! Players must collect falling snowflakes to fuel their snowballs and find all 24 Skylets. The goal is to gather snowflakes and use them wisely to locate all the Skylets!
</p>
<p>
I was the primary programmer on this project, and it was developed entirely in just one week as part of ToastieLabsâ€™ participation in the Jingle Jam (2024). Following its initial release, the game was later launched on Steam with achievements, helping promote Skystead Ranch leading up to its release.
